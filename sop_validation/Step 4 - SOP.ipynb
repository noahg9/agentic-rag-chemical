      "11. Wait 1 hour and cool the mixture to 75ºC. Take a sample and send it to the control lab to analyse free alkali, diethanolamine, and ester band. If parameters are correct OK. If parameters are incorrect, make necessary adjustments: To reduce free diethanolamine, adjust with Palm Kernel Oil To lower the ester band, adjust with Diethanolamine. To adjust the alkali level, use Sodium Methylate 30%. Note: As the reaction progresses, diethanolamine and ester band values will decrease. Once the product is cooled, the ester band will continue decreasing slowly, while the diethanolamine value will hardly change. For proper adjustment, diethanolamine should be between 4.8-5.3 mg KOH/g, and the ester band should be between 8.5-9.5%, always with the presence of alkali.\n",

If parameters are incorrect, make necessary adjustments: To reduce free diethanolamine, adjust with Palm Kernel Oil To lower the ester band, adjust with Diethanolamine. To adjust the alkali level, use Sodium Methylate 30%. Note: As the reaction progresses, diethanolamine and ester band values will decrease. Once the product is cooled, the ester band will continue decreasing slowly, while the diethanolamine value will hardly change. For proper adjustment, diethanolamine should be between 4.8-5.3 mg KOH/g, and the ester band should be between 8.5-9.5%, always with the presence of alkali.\n",
